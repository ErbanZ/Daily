    <p>1.1 Definition of Personal Information and What Personal Information is collected by us</p>
    <p><br></p>

        thecamera of the Products will collect the information of the projection picture (capture the shape of the

    <p><br></p>
    <p>Furthermore, the gyroscope will collect the six direction information of the Products (the angle placed by the
        Products itself, including pitch angle and horizontal angle, excluding the longitude and latitude of the
        equipment, precise positioning or position information), which is used for automatic trapezoidal correction of
        displacement and automatic focusing of displacement to detect whether the projector moves, and the data will be
        saved to the Products and the server.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>We may collect screen front depth information and infrared information through 3D ToF (some products may install

    <p><br></p>
    <p>1.1.3 Information from third-party sources&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When permitted by law, we will collect information about you from third-party sources. For example:</p>
    <p> for certain services that might include account and financial transactions, with your authorisation, we may
        validate the information provided by you (such as phone number) through legitimate third-party sources for
        security and fraud prevention purposes;</p>
    <p> we may also obtain certain information such as account IDs, nicknames, avatar, and email address from
        third-party social network services (e.g. when you use a social network account to sign in to XGIMI service);
    </p>

        us when they buy products for you via the Site services</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>1.1.4 Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
    <p>&nbsp;XGIMI may also collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”). Non-PII is information
        that cannot be used to identify a particular individual. For example,&nbsp;</p>
    <p>XGIMI will collect statistical data, such as the numbers of visits to our Site. We collect the data to
        betterly understand and analyze how users use our Site, products, services so that we can improve our services
        and betterly satisfy users’needs.</p>
    <p>To agregate the data to help us understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences, improve the XGIMI
        Products and Services, and develop new products, services, features, and functionality.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>The purpose for such collecting is to improve the services we provide to you. The type and amount of information
        collected depends on how you use our products and/or services.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>We aggregate such information to provide you with more useful information, and understand which parts of Sites,
        products and services you are most interested in. For example, we may only need the number of users who are
        active in a day; and we don't need to know in that day who is active, so aggregate data is enough for
        statistical analysis. We will endeavor to isolate your personal data from non-personally identifiable
        information and ensure that the two types of data are used separately. However, if we combine non-personally
        identifiable information with personal information, such combined information will be treated as personal
        information for as long as it remains combined.</p>
    <p>XGIMI may, at its own discretion, collect, use, process, transfer, or disclose Non-PII for other purposes.&nbsp;
